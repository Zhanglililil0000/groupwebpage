										<h2>Second Harmonic Generation(SHG)</h2>

									<div class="row gtr-200">

											<h3>
												What is Second Harmonic Generation?
											</h3>
											<p>
												Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) is a nonlinear optical process in which two photons with the same frequency combine in a nonlinear material, and generate a single photon with twice the energy, frequency, and half the wavelength of the original photons.
											</p>

											<p>
												The process of SHG requires a material that lacks inversion symmetry, such as some crystals and molecules. In these materials, the electric field generated by the two photons can interact with the electrons in the material, producing a net polarization that oscillates at twice the frequency of the original photons. This oscillating polarization then radiates a photon at the second harmonic frequency.
											</p>

											<p>
												SHG is used in various applications, such as laser frequency doubling, biomedical imaging, and materials characterization. It is a powerful tool for studying the properties of materials, and it provides a non-destructive way to probe the surface and interface of materials.
											</p>
											<h3>
												Can Second Harmonic Generation detect chirality?
											</h3>
											<p>
												Yes, Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) can detect chirality. Chirality refers to the property of molecules that are not superimposable on their mirror images. Since SHG is a sensitive probe of the symmetry of a material, it can detect the chirality of molecules by measuring the difference in SHG signal between a chiral molecule and its mirror image.
											</p>
											<p>
												The SHG response of a chiral molecule is dependent on the orientation of the molecule with respect to the polarization of the incident light. In a mirror-image molecule, the orientation is reversed, which results in a change in the SHG response. By comparing the SHG response of a chiral molecule with that of its mirror image, it is possible to detect the molecule's chirality.
											</p>
											<p>
												SHG has become a powerful technique for studying chiral structures in various fields, such as chemistry, biochemistry, and materials science. It has been used to study the chirality of molecules in solution, at interfaces, and in thin films, and it has the potential to provide a new approach for developing chiral sensors and devices.

										<h2>Broad-Band Sum-Frequency Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy(BB-SFG-VS)</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="row gtr-200">
										<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
											<p>
												BB-SFG is a nonlinear vibrational spectroscopy technique that combines the advantages of SFG spectroscopy with broadband mid-infrared (MIR) spectroscopy. It enables the detection of molecular vibrations in the MIR spectral region with high sensitivity and selectivity.
											</p>
											<p>
												In BB-SFG, infrared beam is mixed with a visible beam in a nonlinear crystal, generating a sum frequency signal. The resulting spectrum provides information about the vibrational modes of molecules at interfaces and in thin films.
											</p>
											<p>
												BB-SFG has several advantages over traditional SFG spectroscopy. First, it provides access to the entire MIR spectral region, which contains rich vibrational information about chemical bonds and functional groups. Second, it is capable of measuring the absolute intensity of the vibrational modes, which can provide quantitative information about molecular structures and concentrations. Finally, it can be used to study complex molecular systems, such as proteins and nucleic acids, in situ and in real time.
											</p>
											<p>
												BB-SFG has found applications in a wide range of fields, including surface chemistry, catalysis, biochemistry, and materials science. It has been used to study the structure and dynamics of molecules at interfaces, the adsorption and reaction of molecules on surfaces, and the conformation and orientation of biomolecules.
											</p>
											<p>
												Overall, BB-SFG is a powerful tool for studying molecular structures and dynamics at interfaces and in thin films with high sensitivity and selectivity. Its combination of broadband MIR spectroscopy with SFG spectroscopy makes it a unique and valuable technique for a range of scientific and technological applications.

										<h2>High Repetition Rate Sum-frequency Generation Vibrational Spectroscopy (HRR-SFG)</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="row gtr-200">
										<div class="col-8 col-12-medium">
											<p>
												In HRR-SFG, a high-repetition-rate pulsed laser is used to generate two input beams, one in the visible range and one in the mid-infrared range. The two beams are then combined in a nonlinear crystal to generate a sum frequency signal. The resulting spectrum provides information about the vibrational modes of molecules at the interface or surface. 
											</p>
											<p>
												HRR-SFG is a powerful technique for studying molecular structures and dynamics in real-time and in situ. It can be used to investigate a wide range of interfacial phenomena, including adsorption, desorption, and chemical reactions. HRR-SFG is particularly useful for studying dynamic processes because it can provide information about the rates and mechanisms of molecular processes at surfaces and interfaces.
											</p>
											<p>
												Overall, HRR-SFG is a valuable tool for studying interfacial phenomena in chemistry, materials science, and biophysics. It can provide detailed information about molecular structures and dynamics at interfaces with high sensitivity and temporal resolution.

										<h2>SHG Imaging Microscopy</h2>
									</header>
									<div class="row gtr-200">

											<p>
												Second Harmonic Generation (SHG) imaging microscopy is a nonlinear optical microscopy technique that is used to image biological tissues and materials with high spatial resolution and contrast.
											</p>
											<p>
												SHG imaging microscopy is based on the second-order nonlinear optical process of SHG, which occurs when two photons of the same frequency interact with a noncentrosymmetric medium to generate a photon with twice the frequency. In SHG imaging, a high-intensity laser beam is focused on a sample to generate SHG signals that are detected and analyzed to form images of the sample.
											</p>
											<p>
												SHG imaging microscopy is particularly useful for studying biological tissues and materials that contain noncentrosymmetric structures, such as collagen fibers, muscle fibers, and microtubules. Because SHG signals are generated only in regions of the sample where the noncentrosymmetric structures are present, SHG imaging provides high contrast and specificity for imaging these structures.
											</p>
											<p>
												SHG imaging microscopy has a number of advantages over other imaging techniques. It is noninvasive, label-free, and does not require exogenous contrast agents. It can be used to image tissues and materials in vivo and in situ, with high spatial resolution and minimal phototoxicity. SHG imaging can also be combined with other imaging techniques, such as fluorescence imaging and third-harmonic generation imaging, to provide complementary information about the structure and function of biological tissues and materials.
											</p>
											<p>
												Overall, SHG imaging microscopy is a powerful tool for imaging noncentrosymmetric structures in biological tissues and materials with high spatial resolution and contrast. It has applications in a wide range of fields, including biology, medicine, materials science, and nanotechnology.
